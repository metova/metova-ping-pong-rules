## Basic Doubles Game Play


### Deciding Which Team Serves:

A "ping" takes place, where a random team starts with the ball and serves to the opposing team, saying "P." Each player hits the ball back, and continues to spell "ping." After "G," the next team to lose the play concedes the serve to the other team. The serving team decides among themselves who serves first, while the receiving team decides who will return from that server. This match-up persists throughout the match, that is, you always receive and serve to the same person. 


### The Serve:

After a server is decided, they serve the ball for 5 plays. The server can choose which side to serve from at any point. A serve is valid if it bounces once on the servers side, then crosses the net, then bounces in the opposite opposing box. A "let" occurs and the server may try again if any of the following occur:

* If the ball "glances" off the side of the table on the opposing side, but is otherwise valid.
* If the ball hits the net and/or does not cross to the opposite box, but is otherwise valid.

Once a let occurs, the server may not switch which side they are serving from. If a serve is attempted and the paddle hits the ball, but it was not valid a not a let, that is a failed serve; the opposing team receives a point. If the paddle does not hit the ball after it is thrown, it is treated as a non-attempted serve and does not count for anything.  


### Returning:

After the serve, the player receiving must return it by hitting the ball over the net onto the opposing side; from now on, the box does not matter. The play cycles between players, so in this example the non-server from the opposing side now returns, and then finally the receiving player who has not played yet returns. The play continues to cycle between the players in this order until an invalid return occurs, at which point the opposing team scores one point, and the serve begins again. 

##### Exceptions to a Return:

This should resolve most disputes on whether or a not a return is valid:

* If the ball hits the ceiling during a return, the opposing team receives a point, even if it would've been valid or was otherwise valid. 
* If the ball glances off the side of the table on a non-serve, and is otherwise valid, it's a valid return. 
* If the ball hits the net on a non-serve, and is otherwise valid, it's a valid return. 
* If the ball hits the finger or hand of the paddle-arm on a return (but *not* the arm), and is otherwise valid, it's a valid return. 

In a situation not covered here, but of questionable validity, opt for a redo. 


### Switching Servers:

The serve cycles between each team and player every 5 valid serves. 

##### Example:

If Team 1 has Player 1 and 2, and Team 2 has Player 3 and 4, let's assume Player 1 serves first to Player 3. The serve order is then Player 1 → Player 3 → Player 2 → Player 4 → Player 1, etc.


### End of Game: 

The first team to 21 points wins the match, but must win by two points. Following are specific end-of-game rules. 

##### 20 Points:

When a team reaches 20 points, the losing team immediately gets the serve, with the server being the next player in the normal serve cycle. This player serves for 5 serves, and if the game is still going at that point, and the same team is winning, the serve goes to the other player of the losing team for 5 serves. 

If, however, the losing team also brings their score to 20 without the other team scoring and winning, and then overtake them with a score of 21, the serve switches to the now losing team, once again following the cycle as before. This continues until a team wins by two points, with the serve switching sides if the losing team gains the upperhand.
